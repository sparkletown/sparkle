# Sparkle Web App

Codebase for the Sparkle platform, brought to you by [Sparkle](https://sparklespaces.com/), a platform for the most immersive & interactive virtual events.

### Getting started

What you will need:

- A free Firebase account
- Your favorite command-line interface (e.g. Terminal or zsh on a Mac)
- Optional: accounts with Stripe, Twilio
- A little fairy dust

## Set Up Your Local Environment

### Step 1: Clone the Sparkle Repository

First, clone the repo and `cd` into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sparkletown/sparkle
cd sparkle
```

### Step 2: Install Packages

**Note:** Before you run the next steps, you will need to ensure you have access to the Firebase project you want to use. This access can be set up through the Firebase web UI. The following variables are required to be set up:

```bash
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

Install the platform dependencies with `npm`:

(**Important** `npm` v7+ is not supported, it will cause issues with our `package-lock.json`, and you may end up with the wrong dependency versions. Check your current npm version with `npm -v`.

```bash
npm install
```

Now you're ready to start the server! âœ¨

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is started, your web browser will be opened at http://localhost:3000 (and then it'll be immediately redirected to https://sparklespaces.com/). You can opt out of this by adding the following line to your `.env.local`:

```bash
BROWSER=none
```

To start using the app, navigate to a URL such as http://localhost:3000/v/{venueName} - replacing `{venueName}` with the existing venue you'd like to use.

While you generally won't need to do this while developing locally, you can manually build the platform assets as follows:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Firebase functions

**Note**: You might need to emulate the firebase functions locally before the server can properly start. If you have issues using/editing your actual deployed environment functions, try that.

In a new terminal, from the directory you cloned the code to, enter the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set up Firebase project

If you haven't followed through these steps before then you're going to need to set up a new Firebase environment and configure it. That process is a little longer than would fit comfortably in this README, so we split it out for you:

See [Firebase setup](docs/create-new-environment.md)

### Step 4: Start Your Engines

First, you need to install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).

If you use Homebrew, you can install it as follows:

```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

Otherwise, follow the installation instructions at https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install

Make sure that you have a Stripe account setup and know the login credentials, then run the following commands (replacing `TODO-PROJECTID` with your actual Firebase project ID:

```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5001/TODO-PROJECTID/us-central1/payment-webhooks
```

### Step 5: Firebase Emulators

See [Firebase Emulators](docs/firebase-emulators.md)

## Part Three: Contribute to Sparkle

### Our Git Flow

If you're new to Git / GitHub flows, then you may find these guides helpful:

- https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/
- https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/
- https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

To contribute to the code base, please follow these steps:

- fork the repository (note: Sparkle team skip this step)
- create a new branch from `staging`
- write your code
- create a pull request to merge your branch into `staging`
- wait for code review
- fix any review comments
- once the review has been finalised, a team member will **squash-merge** the PR into `staging`, which will trigger the CI to deploy the `staging` environment

Then, to deploy to `production`, a Sparkle team member will:

- create a PR to **merge staging into `master`** with a name such as **`deploy staging -> master`**
- add the `ðŸš€ deployment` label
- copy the commit messages (including the `#1234` PR they were made in) and paste it into the PR description after `Deploys:` (see [example](https://github.com/sparkletown/sparkle/pull/1355))
- **merge (not squash-merge)** this 'deployment PR' into `master`, this will trigger the CI system to deploy to the '[OG](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/og/) `production`' environment
- push the `master` branch to any other environment branches (eg. `env/foo`) to trigger the CI system to deploy those environments as well

> When adding a quick fix to production:
>
> - create a branch from master
> - code
> - create a pull request on master
> - create a branch from staging
> - cherry-pick the commit
> - create a pull request on staging

### Deploying

Deploys are handled by CircleCI.

- Merging to `staging` will deploy to staging
- Merging to `master` will deploy to production
- Pushing the `master` branch to any of our other configured production branches will deploy to that environment

## Part Four: Addenda

Sparkle is using Bugsnag! We are proud to be part of Bugsnag's open source program and are glad that Bugsnag supports open source.
