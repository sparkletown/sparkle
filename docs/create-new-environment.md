## Firebase Project Setup

### Step 1: Create New Firebase Project

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com

2. Click _Add project_
  - Fill out the name field with something like `example-project`
  - Click _Continue_

3. Optional: Enable Google Analytics
  - Click _Continue_
  - Configure Google Analytics
  - Click _Create project_
  - Wait for project to be created
  - Click _Continue_

This part of the setup is complete!


### Step 2: Configure Firebase Project Settings

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and find the `Example Project` you chose in step 1

2. From _Project Overview_, hover over the gear icon and click _Project Settings_
  - In the _General_ tab:
    - Set the public-facing name
  - In the 'Users & Permissions' tab:
    - Add any other users who will need 'Owner' level access to this project (e.g. a backup owner who can change things if needed, deployments, etc).
    - Add the users who will need 'Editor' level access to this project.

3. Optional: Upgrade your account to Blaze plan.
  - Click the gear icon next to _Project Overview_ again, and then select 'Usage and billing', then select the Blaze plan.

### Step 3: Add a New Web App to the Firebase Project

1. Click on _Project Overview_, then again on _Project Settings_
  - In the _General_ tab:
    - Go to the _Your Apps_ section at the bottom.
    - Click on the `</>` button to create a new web app
    - Add firebase to your web app
    - Choose an app nickname (eg. `example-project`)
    - Tick 'Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app', leaving the dropdown that appears on the default setting
    - Click _Register app_
    - Wait for the _loading_ spinner to finish
    - Click _Next_ to skip past this screen
    - Click _Next_ to skip past this screen as well
    - Finally, you can click _Continue to the console_ to skip past this last screen

This part of the setup is now complete!

### Step 4: Set up Firebase Hosting

1. From the Firebase console, within the appropriate project, click on _Hosting_ on the left hand menu.

2. Click on _Get started_
  - You can skip through these next screens by clicking _Next_
  - Click _Continue to the console_

3. Optional: Add a custom domain
  - In the hosting dashboard, click _Add custom domain_
  - Enter the details for the domain to use (eg. `example.sparkle.space`)
    - **Note:** you will also need to configure the DNS to make this work properly (see below), and this may take 24-48hrs to take effect
  - Ensure 'Redirect `example.sparkle.space` to an existing website' is not selected
  - Click _Continue_
  - If you haven't verified your domain before, you'll need to do this here. You will likely need to create a DNS 'TXT' record to prove that you own the domain, containing a `google-site-verification` value
  - You can follow similar steps to the ones described below to do this: _Enter domain --> Verify ownership --> Go live_
  - You will need to enter the provided DNS 'A' records into your domain registrar (eg. GoDaddy) to point your domain at the Firebase servers (record type, host, value)

You can close this page and return to the Firebase console.

### Step 5: Set up Firebase Authentication

1. From the Firebase console, within the appropriate project, click on ['Authentication'] on the left hand menu

2. Click on _Get Started_
  -  In the ‘Sign-in method’ tab:
    - Hover over ‘Email/Password’, then click the edit icon (pencil)
    - Select ‘enabled’ (but leave email link ‘passwordless sign in’ disabled)
    - Click _Save_
    - Scroll down to 'Authorised domains'
    - Click _Add domain_
    - In the 'Domain' field, enter the custom domain we created above (eg. `example.sparkle.space`)
    - Click _Add_
    - Scroll down to 'Advanced'

3. Optional: _Note that there is a 'Manage sign-up quota' setting, which defaults to `100` signups per hour from the same IP address. Under most normal cases, this probably doesn't need to be changed, but sometimes (eg. employees all accessing from the same office, therefore having the same IP address), you may need to temporarily increase this limit._

    - To do this, click _Change_
    - Configure 'Sign-ups per hour', 'Start Date', 'Time', and 'Duration (days)' as required
      - 'Sign-ups per hour' must be between `1` and `1000`
      - 'Start Date' must be in the future
      - 'Duration (days)' must be between `1` and `7`
    - Click _Save_
    - Notice the 'Sign-up quota change scheduled' notification

This part of the setup is complete!

### Step 6: Set up Twilio Account

Please see [Twilio Account Setup](twilio-configuration.md)

### Step 7: Generate Private Key File

Please refer to [Generate Private Key File](../scripts/README.md)

### Step 8: Configure Firebase Functions

Before you run the following steps, you will need to ensure you have access to the Firebase project you want to use. This access can be set up through the Firebase web UI.

In a new terminal, from the directory you cloned the code to, enter the following commands:

```bash
# While not necessary (as we already include it in our devDependencies), you can install the firebase-tools globally if desired
# npm install -g firebase-tools@latest

# Move into the firebase functions directory
cd functions

# Install the function dependencies
npm install

# Go back to the root app directory to use firebase package
cd ..

# Login to firebase with the account that has access to this project. You'll be prompted to log in via Google OAuth.
npx firebase login

# Find the ID of the project that you'd like to use from the output of the command below:
npx firebase projects:list

# If you are contributing to the Sparkle main code base, switch to the 'staging' project, otherwise switch to 'example-project' or whichever environment you are developing against
npx firebase use TODO-PROJECT-ID
```

Now you need to set up the function config

```bash
npx firebase --project TODO-PROJECT-ID functions:config:set project.id=TODO-PROJECT-ID twilio.account_sid=TODO twilio.api_key=TODO twilio.api_secret=TODO stripe.endpoint_secret=TODO stripe.secret_key=TODO
```

# Go to <projectRoot>/scripts

Now we need to upload function config to Firebase. Use the `.json` file with private key that you've downloaded just recently:

```bash
./upload-function-config-service-account.ts TODO-PROJECT-ID example-project-firebase-adminsdk-XXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX.json
```

```bash
# Copy the runtime config locally
npx firebase functions:config:get > ./functions/.runtimeconfig.json

# Finally, we need to perform the first deploy to the functions manually, to make sure all of the required cloud API's get enabled/etc, then after that, CI should be able to do it for us going forward:

npx firebase --project TODO-PROJECT-ID deploy --only functions
```

# You may need to run this a couple of times, as it seems to cause various Google cloud APIs to get enabled/etc, which sometimes fail/time out. As a result you should see following message:

```
Deploy complete!
```

This part of the setup is complete!

### Step 9: Bootstrap application environment

In order to run Sparkle you'd need to bootstrap and connect your local application with the Firebase environment that you've created. Please follow the link below for detailed information.

See [Bootstrap application](bootstrap-application.md)
