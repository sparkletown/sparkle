## Partymap/Screening room/Embeddable/External room

Given that there is no users actively used, the current max is 10 000

## Auditorium

10 000 users, +-350 users per section. 28 sections

## Everything that has unoptimized tables: Conversation space / Music Venue(Jazzbar)

Tested with 650 users. More info in https://doesitsparkle.slack.com/archives/C01TMQC20TH/p1637872177002000.
The performance is actually limited by the display of tables themselves, not users.

## Poster hall could potentially be as performant as partymap if the amount of posters is reasonable. Up to 500 posters should work decently

## Chat messaging

~3 messages a second was tested
