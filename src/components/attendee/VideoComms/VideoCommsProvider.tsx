/**
 * The VideoCommsProvider provides an API for interacting with video comms.
 * It uses a single instance of TwilioImplementation that lasts for the entire
 * lifecycle of the component. It is expected that only one VideoCommsProvider
 * is in existence at any one time and that it is kept mounted between route
 * changes in the attendee experience - thus allowing for persistent
 * video chat as attendees move around.
 *
 * The implementation of Twilio has been done outside of React as attempting
 * to use React hooks with Twilio led to convoluted code that was hard to
 * follow, hard to debug and often re-rendered unexpectedly.
 *
 * It is expected that developers wanting to add video comms to their
 * spaces will use the components *outside* of the `internal` directory. The
 * internal components are low level primitives that are used by the higher
 * level components.
