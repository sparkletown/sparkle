Getting started
===============

To launch the development server do the following:

	a) Launch the Visual Studio Solution "Serverside Code.sln".

	b) Right-click Player.IO Test Server and choose "Set as Startup Project"

	c) Press F5. This should start the development server.
	   If a windows Firewall dialog pops up, press allow.
	
To launch the client do the following:
	
	a) Edit the Game.htm file where it says "[Enter your game id here]".
	If you don't have a gameid, simply login into the PlayerIO admin dashboard
	and click "create game".

	b) Open Game.htm in a browser.

If all goes well, you should see the client connect to the development
server in both the client and the development server window.
